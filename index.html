			<p><span id="about">Hi</span><span id="about-text">,This is  Amit, I really excited about two subjects, Art & Science which is everything for me. I am trying to develop something new tech-based unique ideas which might be really helpful and also joyful for the human. I have more than two years of experience in numerous companies as a freelancer of Graphics Designer and my favourite part is the logo designing.  As a full-time graphics designer, I am working with Fresosoft. And I am also working as a team member plus developer in Creativegun. Little novice, still experienced with 3D modelling, credit goes to my work experience with Increation.</span></p>
